```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
data <- read.csv(file="https://onlinestatbook.com/case_studies_rvls/physical_strength/data.txt",sep="",header=TRUE)  
```



##Model 1

find an equation that expresses SIMS as a function of ARM

## Results

### Graphical Results

```{r}
plot(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
```

As arms strength increases, sims score increases.  There is a positive trend between arn strength and sim score.

### Numerical Results

```{r}
cor(data$SIMS, data$ARM)
```
This trend shows that we have a positive coloration of .68

### inference


```{r}
Model1 = lm(SIMS~ARM, data = data)
print(summary(Model1))
```



```{r}
plot(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
abline(Model1, col = "red")
```

for an increase of 1 in arm strength, sim score increases by 0.0545.
